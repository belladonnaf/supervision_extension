# CURL Crawler

## Description

CURL Crawler is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to make retrieving HTTP response values easier. The tool works by allowing you to copy the `curl` command from Chrome DevTools (or any browser's developer tools), paste it into VSCode, and execute it. This extension processes the `curl` command, sending the request to the server and retrieving the response data. It provides a simple way to test APIs or debug network requests directly from your development environment.

## Features

- Copy `curl` commands from Chrome DevTools (or other browsers) and execute them in VSCode.
- Automatically parse and send HTTP requests to the server.
- View detailed response output within VSCode.
- Useful for API testing, debugging, and network request analysis.
- Easy integration into your existing workflow within Visual Studio Code.

## Installation

1. Open **Visual Studio Code**.
2. Go to **Extensions** (`Ctrl+Shift+X`).
3. Search for `CURL Crawler`.
4. Click **Install**.
5. Once installed, the extension is ready to use.
